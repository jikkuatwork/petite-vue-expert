# Petite Vue

This is an attempt to make a generative tool to assist using Petite Vue.

## How

I am trying to build a LLM context with the code of the framework with
associated dependencies. For ease of iteration I am also providing the
instruction to the model in a file: `instructions.md`.

## Finding

- Looks like the context is largely ignored
- Instructions provided via file & in chat is somehow treated very differently
